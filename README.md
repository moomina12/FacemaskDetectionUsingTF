Face mask detection app using TensorFlow involves multiple steps, including preparing data, building a model, training it, and deploying it for real-time detection using a webcam or uploaded images. 
I have used publicly available datasets for facemask detection, which contain images of people with and without masks.
Build a CNN architecture for the classification task. This model will consist of several convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers. Achieved Test Accuracy of 0.9174496531486511.
Once the model has been built, the next step is to train it. 
App deployment done thru streamlit.
